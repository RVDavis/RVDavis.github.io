<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<h3>2013-2017</h3>
<p><strong>PhD Psychology</strong>, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London. Thesis: “<strong>An Empirical and Computational Investigation of Variable outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorders</strong>”.  Supervised by Professor Michael Thomas and Professor Tony Charman.</p>
<p>My doctoral research aimed to investigate the variability observed in the profiles of autistic children, our ability to predict this variability based on measures in early infancy, and the underlying mechanisms that generate this variability. I combined the analysis of the of data from the world’s largest prospective, longitudinal dataset of children with an increased familial likelihood of autism, with data generated from computational models that I designed and created. I analysed complex datasets with sophisticated longitudinal modelling techniques. I received funding for this research from a Bloomsbury Colleges Scholarship.</p>
<h3>2010-2012</h3>
<p><strong>MSc Cognitive Neuroscience</strong> <em>(Distinction)</em> - University College London &amp;
Birkbeck, University of London.</p>
<p>Dissertation: Tool Use and the Flexibility of the Body Schema in Typically Developing Children. Supervised by Dr Andrew Bremner.</p>

<hr>
<h2>EMPLOYMENT</h2>
<h3>June 2021 - Present</h3>
<p><strong>Lecturer in Psychology &amp; Education</strong>, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. See below for academic service and Dissertation supervision.</p>
<p>I currently teach on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childhood Development</li>

<p>I am the module coordinator for the 4th year research module, Professional Enquiry into Practice.</p>
<h3>January 2018 - June 2021</h3>
<p><strong>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</strong>, Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I led an ESRC-funded project investigating the effects of bilingualism on cognitive and social development in children with and without autism. This included designing and implementing four novel eye tracking paradigms for use with minimally verbal children, and designing parent interview tools.</p>
<h3>January 2017 - December 2017</h3>
<p><strong>Postdoctoral Research Assistant</strong>, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Sciences,Birkbeck, University of London.</p>
<p>This aim of this research project was to assess motor abilities and identify possible differences in cerebral lateralisation in children with and without autism.</p>

<p><strong>Associate Lecturer in Psychology, Birkbeck</strong>, University of London.</p>
<h3>September 2009 - August 2014</h3>
<p><strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> (full time: 2009-2011, 0.3 FTE: 2011-2015)</p>
<hr>
<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<h3>Current research interests</h3>
<p>I am a developmental psychologist and my research focuses on two main areas: (1) Using longitudinal methods to understand early differences in cognitive development, and the subsequent effects on later developmental outcomes. (2) eliciting children’s voices to inform best practice in educational and family settings. This strand of my research is Informed primarily by my experience as a teaching assistant. In both areas I implement novel and engaging methodologies to include children who are frequently excluded from research, including minimally verbal children and children with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Central to this work is a commitment to involving the communities that I study in the research process; ensuring this research has a strong participatory ethos and is of direct and practical relevance to those it affects. I achieve this through a comprehensive programme of dissemination, dialogue and partnership activities. I am also a strong advocate of public engagement and community outreach; ensuring that research is accessible to the public, to policy makers and practitioners, and – importantly – to stakeholders.</p>
